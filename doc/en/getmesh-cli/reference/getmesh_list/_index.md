'*' indicates the currently active istioctl version.

The following is the explanation of each column:

[ISTIO VERSION]
The upstream tagged version of Istio on which the distribution is built.

[FLAVOR]
The kind of the distribution. As of now, there are three flavors "tetrate",
"tetratefips" and "istio".

- "tetrate" flavor equals the upstream Istio except it is built by Tetrate.
- "tetratefips" flavor is FIPS-compliant, and can be used for installing FIPS-compliant control plain and data plain built by Tetrate.
- "istio" flavor is the upstream build. Flavor version for upstream build will always be '0'

[FLAVOR VERSION]
The flavor's version. A flavor version 0 maps to the distribution that is built on 
exactly the same source code of the corresponding upstream Istio version.

[K8S VERSIONS]
Supported k8s versions for the distribution
